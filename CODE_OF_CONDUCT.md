# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Welcome to our community! We’re committed to making this a friendly and respectful place for everyone, no matter your age, background, identity, or experience level.

We promise to treat everyone kindly, help each other out, and make sure this community is open, welcoming, and inclusive for all.

## Our Standards

**Here’s how we can all help create a positive environment:**

- Show empathy and kindness toward others
- Respect different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Give and accept constructive feedback graciously
- Own up to mistakes, apologize, and learn from them

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are here to help keep things safe and friendly. They’ll clarify and enforce these standards, and may take fair action if someone acts inappropriately, including removing or editing content, or even banning users if necessary. When moderation decisions are made, leaders will explain why when appropriate.

## Scope

This code applies to all community spaces, whether online or offline, and whenever you’re officially representing our community (like using an official email or social media account).

## Reporting Problems
