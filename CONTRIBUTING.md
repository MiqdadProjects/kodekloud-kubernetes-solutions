## üìè Contribution Guidelines

To ensure consistency and quality, please adhere to these guidelines:

### General Guidelines
- **Be Respectful**: Foster a positive, inclusive environment for all contributors.
- **Align with Structure**: Place task solutions in the correct level directory (e.g., `level-4/` for advanced tasks).
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name files as `Task-XX-DescriptiveName.md` (e.g., `Task-06-WordPressDeployment.md`) to avoid naming issues in VS Code.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Validate YAML manifests and ensure solutions work in a Kubernetes environment.
- **Document Clearly**: Provide detailed instructions, verification steps, and troubleshooting in Markdown files.

### Markdown File Structure
New task solutions should follow the structure of existing files (e.g., `level-4/Task-05-GuestBookAppDeployment.md`):
- **Header**: Use emojis and clear task title (e.g., `üåü Task 5 - Deploy Guest Book App on Kubernetes`).
- **Task Description**: Summarize requirements and objectives.
- **Infrastructure Overview**: Describe the Kubernetes environment and resources (e.g., deployments, services).
- **Solution Overview**: Outline the architecture and implementation strategy.
- **Implementation Steps**: Provide step-by-step commands (e.g., `kubectl apply -f file.yaml`).
- **Code Analysis**: Include YAML manifests with explanations of key components.
- **Verification Steps**: List commands to verify the solution (e.g., `kubectl get pods`, `curl http://<node-ip>:<node-port>`).
- **Testing**: Include additional tests (e.g., pod logs, service endpoints).
- **Troubleshooting**: Address common issues with solutions.
- **Production Notes**: Suggest real-world improvements (e.g., network policies, persistence).
- **Learning Outcomes**: Highlight Kubernetes concepts learned.
- **Task Completion Summary**: Confirm task completion with key details.
- **Suggested Filename and Commit Message**: Provide a filename (e.g., `guestbook-task5.yaml`) and Git commit message.

### YAML Standards
- Use appropriate Kubernetes API versions (e.g., `apps/v1` for Deployments, `v1` for Services).
- Specify `namespace: default` unless otherwise required.
- Use 2-space indentation for consistency.
- Include labels for clarity (e.g., `app: guestbook`, `tier: frontend`, `role: master`).
- Validate YAML syntax:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml --dry-run=client
  ```

### Commit Message Format
- Use clear, descriptive messages referencing the task and level:
  - Good: `Add Task 06 solution for Level 4: Deploy WordPress with MySQL`
  - Bad: `Update file`
- Include task number and level for context (e.g., `Fix Task 04 Level 3 YAML`).

### Examples
- **New Task Solution**:
  - File: `level-4/Task-06-WordPressDeployment.md`
  - Content: YAML for WordPress and MySQL deployments, verification steps, troubleshooting.
  - Commit: `Add Task 06 solution for Level 4: Deploy WordPress with MySQL`
- **Documentation Update**:
  - File: `README.md`
  - Content: Add new task to the Level 4 table.
  - Commit: `Update README.md to include Task 06 for Level 4`
